# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to create a reading log, could be used by kids for summer reading but also by adults 
and for any time, not just the summer.  I would like to have accounts for individual users 
and tie it to available JSON data or an API (like https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started) so users 
can search for a book and then select the picture of the book cover that matches exactly what version
of the book they are reading.  Users can log progress by either time or pagecount, or both.  
pulling from JSON will allow the app 
to display selected info in addition to just the title.  stretch goal(s) would be to allow parents 
to set up accounts for and monitor kids use of the app, and award "prizes" or points based on 
reading goals including pages, minutes, book difficulty, etc.  possibly allow friends/parents to 
assign or suggest books to other users.  I got the idea from using both paper and online reading logs.
the paper logs are cumbersome, and the online logs don't have either the "select the matching cover page"
or "give me lots of other info" features.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 
Search: Users will be able to search by title or author for books.
Selection: Users will be able to select from multiple book covers for the specific edition 
that matches what they are reading.
Logging: Users will be able to log their reading activity.  Activity can be logged as either 
hours, or pages, or both.
Comments: Users will be able to log comments on the books they've read.
### Technologies
Unless I learn differently, I'd like to emulate the tech we were using at the end of LC101 unit 2.
Specifically:
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
Interface with book API, probably Google Books (https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
